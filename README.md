# Mistral7B-MHC
Using Mistral 7B Instruct V0.2 for mental health chatbot:

This project involves the use of Mistral 7B Instruct V0.2, the PAIR data set and Zero-Shot-Learning to create a mental health chatbot. 
The scope of this project is to offer users who are apprehensive to discuss about the problems they are facing (or even students if it 
is possible to implement in the future), to offer them a venue to vent about their struggles completely anonymously, while addressing 
their problems and offering them support and basic advice on how to deal with them. This would be especially helpful for people who 
are unable to connect with a mental health practitioner due to time constraints or are hesitant about talking about their mental 
health due to social stigma.
